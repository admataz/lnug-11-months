# LNUG Fictional Talk Agenda: November 2024 - August 2025
Catching up on the 11 months we missed - A fictional but thoroughly researched meetup schedule

What did we miss since the last LNUG?  22 great talks.

I’m sorry. Fear not, I will get you up to speed. 

Expect a lightning whistlestop tour what should have been over the last 11 months.

See the [slides.md](./slides.md) file for an overview of the preesentation, or check this out and build it yourself. Made with [slidedev](https://sli.dev).

If any of the non-talks here feel like something you would want to make real - feel free, and open a talk proposal at our [speakers repos](https://github.com/lnug/speakers)

*All speakers are fictional, but the topics and technical content are based on real developments in the Node.js ecosystem from October 2024 through September 2025.*
