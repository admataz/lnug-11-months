### "Node.js 23: The Features That'll Make You Want to Upgrade Yesterday"
**Speaker:** Sarah Chen-Martinez (Senior Platform Engineer at CloudNinja Ltd)
**Duration:** 20 minutes

**Abstract:** Node.js 23 landed with some game-changing features - ESM modules with `require()` by default, stable `node --run`, and the death of 32-bit Windows support (finally!). Sarah breaks down what these changes mean for your codebase and why the transition from Node 22 LTS might be smoother than you think. Plus, she'll show off some TypeScript support that's still brewing in the experimental pipeline.

**Fun Factor:** Sarah promises to recreate the "This is Fine" dog meme using only Node.js 23 terminal output.
